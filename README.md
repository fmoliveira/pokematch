# Pokematch

- An overengineered pokemon memory game
  - MVP:
	1. ~~Create function that grabs 8 random pokemon from pokeapi~~
	2. ~~Take the 8, double them, then shuffle~~
	3. ~~Display in nice 4x4 grid~~
	3. ~~Flip animation and matching logic~~
	4. ~~Keep track of guesses~~
	5. ~~Confetti when you win~~
	6. ~~Restart game and generate new set of random pokemons~~

- TODO maybe
  - ~~Next game will move on to next pokemon generation~~
  - ~~Different card backings per generation~~
  - ~~Sounds~~
  - End game screen for passing gen 9
  - Different difficulties
